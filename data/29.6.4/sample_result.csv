How is that so, if I use their sound, and credit them properly, all I\'m doing is bring more awareness to THEIR property, but tiktok doesn\'t allow you to use their sound at all. I\'m want to credit the original creator, I am willing to credit the original creator. But tiktok has no crediting option, so I\'m stuck with a muted edit.', ""I love tik tok. But there's a problem. You see I have a Samsung Galaxy a15 and I always try to do 60 second tik toks. The problem is it never works. Even if I press 60 sec tik tok it will automatically be a 15 second tiktok. I updated it multiple times and it never did anything. I updated it today and only let me do one 60 second tik tok then it was automatically a 15 second tik tok. I ask if you can fix this."", ""Every single time, I want to upload a cover I did and edit it for 2 minutes and having the same song on there, which most of the time its not the best part of the song. There should be when you add a song to private . Youcan see if it gets muted or not. I've tried uploading it 7 times, and all got muted because after the 60 seconds after that , t'll get muted. Im a small creator on tiktok . do this because I enjoy it. Now, if a big creator did it I bet you let that slide.""]"

But I've come across an issue where no matter how hard I try, I just can't follow people. I've checked the internet for answers, I've tried for weeks, but it just won't let me follow people. Sometimes I can get my following thing to go up by 1 but the moment I refresh my profile it's back to 0. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 4 of 5 stars."", ""Honestly, the best social media app in my opinion. There is one thing that bugs me about it though, it's still worth a 5. The ghazal I'm referring to is that sometimes I follow someone and don't like a video. The button will work like this. Like, when I press follow, the bit changes to unfollow, etc. But when I look at my following list, your account(s) are not listed, and when I look at my favorites list, the video is not clear at all. They remain on my wish list.besides those issues,TikTok Fun""]"

Firstly, the block list. I dont know if this is just for android but in the 4 years i had tiktok, i switched phones and it was still the same thing. When i unblock a person it makes me automatically go to the top of the block list, witch becomes annoying as the time passes. Second, the picte update.

FIX THIS', ""I still really love tiktok it let me meet new people and made my life a little better but it has been crashing a lot and it would be better f it was fixed. Also us, android users, don't have dark mode and it would be amazing if dark mode was added to android phones, Samsung specifically. Update: some things start disappearing: the photo swipe slideshow, voice affects, the recording and almost the entire thing is back to how it was in 2020 when I First downloaded and I'm very upset. Please fix."", ""No Filters work..Samsung A54....

Your loosing me tictok."", ""How to lose a day. As good and funny as it can get, it's horribly time-consuming. It's very addictive and can be dangerous for the kids. After some time tiktok will start showing you videos of certain things, clothes, foods... just to make you buy them. It's horrible propaganda of certain things as well but of course you don't care because everyone have tik tok so you got to have it as well. Videos are starting to freeze or won't load + sound plays even after leaving app or locking your screen"", ""Love tiktok. Honestly, if it wasn't for TT, I wouldn't know what was going on in the world. The news always lies, that's one reason I quit watching it. Or they don't tell the whole truth. I meet awesome people on there, and also get informed on who to watch for (bad people) I learn new things more than I normally would because of TT!

    "I'll admit, this clustering-into-topic algorithm is more useful than I thought. Intuitively, when people visit the app's page on the app store, mostly to complain or (they're paid to) praise, if they see another person already making the same complaint, they would just upvote and not submit their own reviews. Which is to say, each problem would be summarized by 1 review, with a lot of people voting and nodding their heads, and it wouldn't make sense to do clustering. However, it seems that people would discover different bugs about the same features, which then, since their contents are similar, can be neatly classified into clusters. For practical purposes, instead of having to read all hundreds of reviews, or ONLY reading the most upvoted ones and potentially miss critical feedbacks, these tools can be used to categorize reviews! The curator would be able to pass each clusters into the team responsible to the feature (UX to design team, ads to recommendation team).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"neat\" here is not perfect of course, as you can see by ranking them by upvotes within a cluster, there are a lot of variations between the top reviews. And of course, the most unique keywords by TF-IDF is flawed, since they relied on word frequency and not semantics to determine representitiveness. Given more time and compute, one can definitely improve the results. One can use the hierachy extracted to consider merging the clusters when it makes sense. The thumbs up counts present an informative parameter, which can be integrated and used to improve various modules in Bertopic. For example, creating weighted sub-graphs between points in the earlier stage of DBSCAN can incorporate information about upvotes, and not just use cosine similarity. One can also pass these most representitive docs through an LLM for it to give better summary and list of keywords. While we're at the topic of LLM, you can ask the LLM to rewrite the reviews in specific format, like {user, feature, issue, keyword}, which would help Bertopic even more. Hell, with Gemini's 1M context windows, you should be able to put all 150 reviews or so of 1 version. Its performance? You'd have to try it and tell me. Needle-in-haystack evaluation is kinda wack for how silly it is, but that's just my humble opinion. Idk if it is the best representation of long-context capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "That leads us to elephant in the room, which is evaluation. In all cases, all applications need to evaluated to understand its performance and how to improve it. However, this dataset does not give classification information, and thus there's no way for us quantitatively test our clustering. One can argue that LLM is coming close to human intelligence and use it to create pseudo-labels for this task, but, again, that assumption itself would require testing. As for me, I just want to explore a dataset and try out tech for a simple application. This is too much excitement for one day already, so Imma leave the rest of the work as homework for my dear reader(s). Peace! "
